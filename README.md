# To run this code you need to first install all dependencies by running yarn in the CLI

# As this was my first experience with blockchain, I am submitting what I have because of the time complexity in which it took me to solve this problem.

# This project could be made better by turning the functionality of the constructor into middlewear
# When you run an api call which could be tested in postman you could have routes that do things such as create new transaction
# A route that gets all blocks and transactions of the chain
# or even a route that returns the ticket number of a match
